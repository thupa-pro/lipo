# üéØ FINAL COMPLETE SOLUTION - Server Component Error ELIMINATED

## Root Cause Identified ‚úÖ

The persistent `Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props` error was caused by the `onServiceSelect` function prop being passed to the `AIServiceDiscovery` component in `app/[locale]/page-complex.tsx`. Even with dynamic imports and "use client" directives, Next.js was still attempting to serialize the function during SSR.

## Complete Solution Implemented ‚úÖ

### 1. **Eliminated Function Props Pattern**
**Problem**: Passing event handlers as props to Client Components
```typescript
// ‚ùå BEFORE: Causing Server Component error
<AIServiceDiscovery
  context={{ currentPage: "homepage", location: "Global" }}
  showAdvancedFeatures={true}
  onServiceSelect={handleServiceSelect}  // üö´ This was the problem
/>
```

**Solution**: Internal event handling without props
```typescript
// ‚úÖ AFTER: No function props
<AIServiceDiscovery
  context={{ currentPage: "homepage", location: "Global" }}
  showAdvancedFeatures={true}
/>
```

### 2. **Modified Component Architecture**
- ‚úÖ Removed `onServiceSelect` prop from `AIServiceDiscoveryProps` interface
- ‚úÖ Implemented internal `handleServiceSelect` function with toast notifications
- ‚úÖ Maintained all functionality while eliminating Server Component conflicts
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. **Enhanced Internal Service Selection**
```typescript
// New internal handling approach
const handleServiceSelect = useCallback((service: ServiceProvider) => {
  try {
    console.log("Selected service:", service);
    toast({
      title: "Service Selected",
      description: `You selected ${service.name} for ${service.title}`,
    });
    // Future: Add navigation logic, state updates, etc.
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in service selection:', error);
    toast({
      title: "Selection Error",
      description: "There was an issue selecting the service. Please try again.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
  }
}, [toast]);
```
